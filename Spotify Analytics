# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Create the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

Select *
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Limit 5;

#1. Select the top 10 songs and the artist, starting with the most popular.
Select artist_name, track_name
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order By popularity desc
Limit 10;

#2. Calculate the average popularity of the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or better, 
show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a "Top Star". (Use a CTE)
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS 
(SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT  artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
